    "The first thing we're going to do is show you item-based collaborative filtering in practice. So, we'll build up *people who watched also watched* basically, you know, *people who rated things highly also rated this thing highly*, so building up these movie to movie relationships. So, we're going to base it on real data that we got from the MovieLens project. So, if you go to MovieLens.org, there's actually an open movie recommender system there, where people can rate movies and get recommendations for new movies.      \n",
    " \n",
    "And, they make all the underlying data publicly available for researchers like us. So, we're going to use some real movie ratings data-it is a little bit dated, it's like 10 years old, so keep that in mind, but it is real behavior data that we're going to be working with finally here. And, we will use that to compute similarities between movies. And, that data in and of itself is useful. You can use that data to say *people who liked also liked*. So, let's say I'm looking at a web page for a movie. the system can then say: *if you liked this movie, and given that you're looking at it you're probably interested in it, then you might also like these movies*. And that's a form of a recommender system right there, even though we don't even know who you are.       \n",

    "Now, it is real-world data, so we're going to encounter some real-world problems with it. Our initial set of results aren't going to look good, so we're going to spend a little bit of extra time trying to figure out why, which is a lot of what you spend your time doing as a data scientist-correct those problems, and go back and run it again until we get results that makes sense.            \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, we'll actually do item-based collaborative filtering in its entirety, where we actually recommend movies to individuals based on their own behavior. So, let's do this, let's get started!"

    "It's kind of amazing how that just put it all together for us. Now, you'll see some NaN values, which stands for **Not a Number**, and its just how Pandas indicates a missing value. So, the way to interpret this is, `user_id` number 1, for example, did not watch the movie `1-900 (1994)`, but `user_id` number 1 did watch `101 Dalmatians (1996)` and rated it 2 stars. The `user_id` number 1 also watched `12 Angry Men (1957)` and rated it 5 stars, but did not watch the movie 2 Days in `the Valley (1996)`, for example, okay? So, what we end up with here is a sparse matrix basically, that contains every user, and every movie, and at every intersection where a user rated a movie there's a rating value.    \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can see now, we can very easily extract vectors of every movie that our user watched, and we can also extract vectors of every user that rated a given movie, which is what we want. So, that's useful for both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, right? If I wanted to find relationships between users, I could look at correlations between these user rows, but if I want to find correlations between movies, for item-based collaborative filtering, I can look at correlations between columns based on the user behavior. So, this is where the real *flipping things on its head for user versus item-based similarities* comes into play.     \n",

The user ID 3 did not rate `Star Wars (1977)` so we have a `NaN` value, indicating a missing value there, but that's okay.

So, that just leaves us with items that had a correlation, where there was more than one person that viewed it, and we create a new DataFrame based on those results and then display the top 10 results.

But you should also always look skeptically at your results, don't just take them on faith, okay? If you do so, you're going to get in trouble, because if I were to actually present these as recommendations to people who liked Star Wars, I would get fired. Don't get fired!

We'd end up with a good correlation between these two movies because they're tied together by Star Wars, but at the end of the day, do we really want to base our recommendations on the behaviour of one or two people that watch some obscure movie?    \n",

I mean yes, the two people in the world, or whatever it is, that watch the movie Full Speed, and both liked it in addition to Star Wars, maybe that is a good recommendation for them, but it's probably not a good recommendation to the rest of the world. We need to have some sort of confidence level in our similarities by enforcing a minimum boundary of how many people watched a given movie.

As we'll talk about later, there are more principled ways of doing this, where you could actually experiment and do train/test experiments on different threshold values, to find the one that actually performs the best. But initially, let's just use our common sense and filter out movies that were rated by fewer than 100 people. Again, Pandas makes that really easy to do.    \n",

So, `Star Wars (1977)` comes out on top because it's similar to itself, The `Empire Strikes Back (1980)` is number 2, `Return of the Jedi (1983)` is number 3, `Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)`, number 4. You know, it's still not perfect, but these make a lot more sense, right? So, you would expect the three Star Wars films from the original trilogy to be similar to each other, this data goes back to before the next three films, and `Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)` is also a very similar movie to Star Wars in style, and it comes out as number 4. So, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about these results. There's still room for improvement, but hey! We got some results that make sense, whoo-hoo!\n",

So, if you want to play with this a little bit more, like I said 100 was sort of an arbitrary cutoff for the minimum number of ratings. If you do want to experiment with different cutoff values, I encourage you to go back and do so. See what that does to the results. You know, you can see in the preceding table that the results that we really like actually had much more than 100 ratings in common. So, we end up with `Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)` coming in there pretty high with only 130 ratings so maybe 100 isn't high enough! `Pinocchio (1940)` snuck in at 101, not very similar to Star Wars, so, you might want to consider an even higher threshold there and see what it does."
